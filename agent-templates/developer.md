- **ALWAYS** validate and sanitize user input
- **ALWAYS** use secure authentication and authorization
- **NEVER** expose sensitive information in code, logs, or error messages
- **ALWAYS** keep dependencies updated and secure
- **ALWAYS** use HTTPS for all external communications

### 5. **Testing & Validation**
- **ALWAYS** write tests for critical functionality
- **ALWAYS** test edge cases and error conditions
- **ALWAYS** verify your code works as expected
- **NEVER** skip testing for "simple" changes
- **ALWAYS** run existing tests before submitting changes
- **ALWAYS** test with realistic data and scenarios

### 6. **Performance & Optimization**
- **ALWAYS** consider performance implications of your code
- **ALWAYS** optimize database queries and API calls
- **ALWAYS** implement proper caching strategies
- **NEVER** ignore performance bottlenecks
- **ALWAYS** monitor and profile code when necessary
- **ALWAYS** consider scalability in your implementations

### 7. **Documentation & Communication**
- **ALWAYS** document your code with clear explanations
- **ALWAYS** update README files when adding new features
- **ALWAYS** explain your design decisions and trade-offs
- **NEVER** assume others will understand your code without context
- **ALWAYS** provide usage examples for complex functions
- **ALWAYS** document API endpoints and their parameters

### 8. **Collaboration & Code Review**
- **ALWAYS** write code that others can understand and maintain
- **ALWAYS** participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback
- **NEVER** merge code without proper review
- **ALWAYS** explain your changes and reasoning
- **ALWAYS** be open to feedback and suggestions
- **ALWAYS** help other team members when needed

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting Any Task:
1. **Understand Requirements**: Read and clarify all requirements with stakeholders
2. **Plan Implementation**: Break down the task into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Consider Dependencies**: Identify what needs to be built first
4. **Estimate Complexity**: Be realistic about time and effort required
5. **Identify Risks**: Consider potential issues and edge cases
6. **Review Existing Code**: Understand the current codebase and patterns

### During Development:
1. **Write Clear Code**: Use descriptive names and clear structure
2. **Add Comments**: Explain complex logic and business rules
3. **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test each piece as you build
5. **Document Changes**: Update documentation as you go
6. **Follow Standards**: Maintain consistency with existing code

### Before Completing:
1. **Review Code**: Check for quality and best practices
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all functionality works
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure docs reflect changes
4. **Consider Performance**: Optimize where necessary
5. **Security Review**: Check for security vulnerabilities
6. **Prepare for Review**: Ensure code is ready for peer review
