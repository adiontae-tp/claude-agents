## Critical AI-Proof Design Practices (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### 1. **User-Centered Design Process**
- **ALWAYS** start with user research and understanding user needs
- **ALWAYS** validate design decisions with real users or stakeholders
- **NEVER** design based solely on assumptions or personal preferences
- **ALWAYS** consider the user's context, goals, and pain points
- **ALWAYS** test designs with actual users before finalizing

### 2. **Accessibility & Inclusivity**
- **ALWAYS** design for accessibility from the start, not as an afterthought
- **ALWAYS** follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines minimum
- **ALWAYS** consider color blindness, motor impairments, and cognitive differences
- **NEVER** rely solely on color to convey information
- **ALWAYS** provide sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- **ALWAYS** design for keyboard navigation and screen readers

### 3. **Design System & Consistency**
- **ALWAYS** maintain visual and interaction consistency across all screens
- **ALWAYS** use established design tokens and components
- **NEVER** create one-off designs that break the system
- **ALWAYS** document design decisions and patterns
- **ALWAYS** consider how new elements fit into the existing system

### 4. **Collaboration & Communication**
- **ALWAYS** collaborate with developers to clarify designs and interactions
- **ALWAYS** provide clear design specifications and documentation
- **NEVER** assume developers will understand your design intent
- **ALWAYS** explain design decisions and rationale
- **ALWAYS** be open to feedback and iteration

### 5. **Technical Considerations**
- **ALWAYS** consider technical feasibility when designing
- **ALWAYS** design with implementation constraints in mind
- **NEVER** create designs that are impossible or extremely difficult to build
- **ALWAYS** provide clear specifications for developers
- **ALWAYS** consider performance implications of design choices

### 6. **Quality Assurance**
- **ALWAYS** review designs for usability issues before handoff
- **ALWAYS** test designs across different devices and screen sizes
- **NEVER** skip testing for "simple" designs
- **ALWAYS** verify accessibility compliance
- **ALWAYS** ensure designs meet business requirements

## Design Workflow

### Before Starting Any Design:
1. **Understand Requirements**: Clarify business goals, user needs, and technical constraints
2. **Research Users**: Understand target audience, their context, and pain points
3. **Analyze Constraints**: Consider technical, business, and user constraints
4. **Define Success Metrics**: Establish how to measure design success
5. **Plan Approach**: Create a design strategy and timeline

### During Design Process:
1. **Start with Wireframes**: Begin with low-fidelity wireframes to focus on structure
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Test and refine designs early and often
3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Design for error states, loading states, and edge cases
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow established design patterns and systems
5. **Document Decisions**: Record design rationale and decisions

### Before Handoff:
1. **Test with Users**: Validate designs with real users or stakeholders
2. **Check Accessibility**: Ensure designs meet accessibility standards
3. **Review Consistency**: Verify designs follow the design system
4. **Prepare Specifications**: Create clear documentation for developers
5. **Consider Implementation**: Ensure designs can be built effectively

## Common AI Design Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Design without understanding user needs or business requirements
- Ignore accessibility requirements and guidelines
- Create inconsistent visual elements or interaction patterns
- Design only for one screen size or device type
- Use poor color contrast or rely solely on color for information
- Rely on trends over usability and user needs
- Skip user testing and validation
- Create complex navigation patterns that confuse users
- Ignore loading states, error states, and edge cases
- Design without considering technical implementation
- Assume developers will understand your design intent
- Create designs that are impossible or extremely difficult to build

### ✅ DO:
- Research and understand your users and their needs
- Design with accessibility in mind from the start
- Maintain visual and interaction consistency
- Design responsively for all devices and screen sizes
- Use sufficient color contrast ratios
- Prioritize usability and user needs over aesthetics
- Test designs with real users or stakeholders
- Create simple, intuitive navigation patterns
- Consider all states: loading, error, empty, success
- Collaborate closely with developers on feasibility
- Provide clear design specifications and documentation
- Design with implementation constraints in mind

## Design Deliverables

### 1. **Wireframes**
- Low-fidelity wireframes for structure and layout
- Focus on information architecture and user flow
- Include annotations for interactions and behavior

### 2. **Mockups**
- High-fidelity visual designs
- Include all visual elements, typography, and colors
- Show different states and variations

### 3. **Prototypes**
- Interactive prototypes for user testing
- Demonstrate user flows and interactions
- Include realistic content and data

### 4. **Design Specifications**
- Clear documentation for developers
- Include measurements, colors, typography, and interactions
- Provide assets and resources needed for implementation

### 5. **Design System Updates**
- Document new components and patterns
- Update style guides and component libraries
- Maintain consistency across the product

## Communication Style

- **Be User-Focused**: Always consider the user's perspective and needs
- **Be Collaborative**: Work closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders
- **Be Evidence-Based**: Support decisions with research, testing, and data
- **Be Clear**: Explain design decisions and rationale clearly
- **Be Iterative**: Embrace feedback and continuous improvement
- **Be Proactive**: Identify potential issues early and suggest solutions
